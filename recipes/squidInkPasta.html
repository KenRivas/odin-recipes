    <h2>Pasta that has been enhanced with the chemical substance extracted from the ocean squid so it becomes very black in color.</h2>
    <p>Squid ink, which is also available from the Cuddlefish (related to the Squid family),
         is added to the water and dough as pasta is made, creating very black colored pasta. 
         This ink provides a salty and somewhat sweet flavor as an ingredient and coloring to
            the pasta. Ribbons of pasta, such as Squid Ink Tagliatelle, are produced that are 
          single pieces of black pasta. Another version of Squid Ink pasta is dual colored
           pasta (due colori) that is produced by combining a ball of black colored pasta
            with a ball of natural or white colored pasta. The dough is rolled flat so the 
            black is on one side and the white on the other and then as it is placed into the 
            pasta maker it comes out with the dual coloring, one for each side.

        This dish famously appeared in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Part 2: Battle Tendency, in which the protagonist, Joseph Joestar, 
        used it as a projectile launched to hit Caesar Zeppeli.

        <li>1 pound medium shrimp, shells removed and deveined (tails optional)</li>
        <li>12 medium scallops</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3/4 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1/3 cup ripe, chopped seeded tomato</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
        <li>1/4 cup juice from 1 to 2 lemons</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 pound squid ink pasta</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium high heat until 
            lightly smoking. Add the shrimp and saut√© until opaque, about 1 minute each side. Remove to a plate.
             Reheat oil and cook the scallops until they too are opaque and lightly browned, 2 minutes each side. 
             Remove the scallops to the plate with the shrimp and add the garlic to the pan. Cook, stirring often,
              until golden, about 2 minutes. Add the red pepper flakes, black pepper, salt, wine, tomato, and parsley, 
              and cook over high heat until reduced by half, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the lemon juice and butter and return 
              the seafood to the skillet, mixing well. Keep warm.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the pasta in a large pot of lightly salted water until it is al dente. Drain well, return to the pot 
            along with the seafood. Toss well, and serve immediately.
